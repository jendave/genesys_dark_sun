\subsubsection{Healing Fruit} \label{itmmgc:healingfruit}
Healing Fruits are fruit grown from magical infused fruit trees.
While using any fruit is possible, often pears are most common.
While they are great for infusing a living body with healing,
their effects do diminish quite fast. The first healing fruit
eaten on a day grants 5 healing, the second eaten the same day
4 healing and so forth.

\subsubsection{Spell Component Pouch}
\label{itmmgc:spellcomponentpouch}
A spell component pouch contains the spell components neccesary to cast spells, the
come with the pouch and are relatively common. There are also components which can
enhance or simplify the casting. Must be sought out by the spell caster and are either
expensive or difficult to gather. Only one component can be used per casting, and a
\despair can signal that the component has been exhausted for the scene. Unlike Primal
Components, Arcane Components can be damaged (but not repaired), or destroyed. See
\cref{sec:repairing-gear} for information regarding damage levels.
