\subsubsection{Limited Ammo}
\label{iqty:limitedammo}
\textbf{Type:} Passive\\
Some weapons fire particularly large or complex
projectiles that cost lots of money. Other weapons are
expendable weapons like grenades that, once used, are
destroyed. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality
may be used to make a number of attacks equal to its
Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with a
maneuver. In addition, each shot expends one of a
limited number of rounds of ammo; more ammo must be
purchased or obtained before anyone fires the weapon
again. This also applies to grenades and other "one-use"
weapons that have the Limited Ammo 1 quality (here,
your character is not "reloading" the grenade, but
drawing another to useâ€”mechanically, they are equivalent).
