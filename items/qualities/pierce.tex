\subsubsection{Pierce}
\label{iqty:pierce}
\textbf{Type:} Passive\\
Any hits from this weapon ignore a number of points
point of soak equal to the weapon’s Pierce rating. If the
weapon has more ranks of Pierce than the target’s total
soak, it completely ignores the target’s soak. For example,
Pierce 3 against a soak of 2 ignores two points of
soak, but the extra point of Pierce has no further effect.
