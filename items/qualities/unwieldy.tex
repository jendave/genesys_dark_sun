\subsubsection{Unwieldy}
\label{iqty:unwieldy}
\textbf{Type:} Passive\\
An Unwieldy weapon is a weapon that can be particularly awkward to use for those
without impressive dexterity and hand-eye coordination. To wield an Unwieldy
weapon properly, the character needs an Agility characteristic equal to or
greater than the weapon's Unwieldy rating. For each point of Agility by which
the character is deficient, they must increase the difficulty of all checks
made while using the weapon by one.
