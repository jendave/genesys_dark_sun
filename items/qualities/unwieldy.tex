\subsubsection{Unwieldy}
\label{iqty:unwieldy}
\textbf{Type:} Passive\\
An Unwieldy weapon is a weapon that can be par-
ticularly awkward to use for those without impres-
sive dexterity and hand-eye coordination. To wield
an Unwieldy weapon properly, the character needs an
Agility characteristic equal to or greater than the weap-
onâ€™s Unwieldy rating. For each point of Agility by which
the character is deficient, they must increase the diffi-
culty of all checks made while using the weapon by one.
