\subsubsection{Linked}
\label{iqty:linked}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
Some weapons are designed to be used together
at the same target. When a character uses a linked
weapon, on a successful attack, the weapon deals
one hit. The wielder may spend \advantage\advantage
to gain an additional hit, and may do so a number of
times equal to the weapon's Linked rating. Additional
hits from the Linked weapon may only be applied against
the original target. Each hit deals the weapon's base
damage plus damage equal to the \success scored on the
check.
