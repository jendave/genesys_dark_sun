\subsubsection{Burn}
\label{iqty:burn}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. When
Burn is triggered, one target hit by the attack continues
to suffer the weapon’s base damage each round for a
number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating.
Apply damage at the start of each of the target’s turns.
If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Burn,
the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a
different target each time.
A victim might be able to stop the damage by per-
forming an action to roll around and make a Coordination check.
The difficulty is Average (\difficulty\difficulty) on hard
surfaces such as the floor of a building, or an Easy (\difficulty)
on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water
stops the damage immediately. Both situations assume
the flame is from actual combustion rather than a
chemical reaction. With the latter, there is usually little
the victim can do.
