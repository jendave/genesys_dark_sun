\subsubsection{Concussive}
\label{iqty:concussive}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
The weapon’s attack can leave the target shell-shocked
from mighty blows or punishing shock waves, unable
to perform any but the most basic actions. When Concussive
is triggered, one target hit by the attack is staggered
(see Genesys pg. 114) for a number of rounds equal to
the weapon’s Concussive rating. A staggered target cannot
perform actions. If multiple targets suffer hits from
a weapon with Concussive, the quality may be triggered
multiple times, affecting a different target each time.
