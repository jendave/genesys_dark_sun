\subsubsection{Prepare}
\label{iqty:prepare}
\textbf{Type:} Passive\\
Items with this quality require time to set up before
being used. The user must perform a number of
preparation maneuvers equal to the item’s Prepare
rating before using the item (if the item is a weapon,
"using" it would be making attacks with the weapon).
At your GM’s discretion, moving with the item, being
knocked prone with the item, or other disruptions may
require the user to perform the preparation maneuvers
again before using the item.
