\subsubsection{Cumbersome}
\label{iqty:cumbersome}
\textbf{Type:} Passive\\
A Cumbersome weapon is large, unwieldy, awkward,
or heavy. To wield a Cumbersome weapon properly,
the character needs a Brawn characteristic equal to
or greater than the weaponâ€™s Cumbersome rating. For
each point of Brawn by which the character is deficient,
they must increase the difficulty of all checks made
while using the weapon by one.
