\subsubsection{Stun}
\label{iqty:stundamage}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
A weapon with this quality can deal strain damage.
When the Stun quality is activated, it inflicts strain
equal to the weapon's Stun rating. Since this is
strain, not strain \textit{damage}, it is not reduced
by a targetâ€™s soak.
