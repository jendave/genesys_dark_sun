\subsubsection{Ensnare}
\label{iqty:ensnare}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
A weapon with Ensnare binds a foe and restricts their
movements. When Ensnare is triggered, one target hit
by the attack becomes immobilized (see Genesys pg. 114)
for a number of rounds equal to the weaponâ€™s Ensnare
rating. An immobilized target cannot perform maneuvers.
If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with
Ensnare, the quality may be triggered multiple times,
affecting a different target each time.
An Ensnared target may perform an action to attempt
a Hard (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty) Athletics
check on their turn to break free from the effect.
