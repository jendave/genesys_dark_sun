\subsubsection{Sunder}
\label{iqty:sunder}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
When activating Sunder, the attacker chooses one item
openly wielded by the target (such as a weapon, shield, or
item on a belt). That item is damaged one step: to minor
if undamaged, from minor to moderate, or from moderate
to major. If an item already suffering major damage is
the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed.
Sunder requires \advantage to activate, and may be activated
even if the attack is unsuccessful. Sunder may be activated
multiple times in the same attack, but each activation
must be applied to the same item, potentially taking
it from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack.
