\subsubsection{Slow-Firing}
\label{iqty:slowfiring}
\textbf{Type:} Passive\\
Slow-Firing weapons tend to deal incredible damage,
but need time to recharge or cool down between shots.
A weaponâ€™s Slow-Firing rating dictates the number of
rounds that must pass before the weapon can be fired
again after attacking. For example, a heavy laser cannon
with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two rounds after being
fired before it can be fired again.
