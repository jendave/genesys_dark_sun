\subsubsection{Auto-Fire}
\label{iqty:autofire}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid
succession and potentially spray an area with bolts,
flechettes, slugs, or other types of projectiles. The
advantage in using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit
multiple targets or to hit a single target multiple times.
As attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally
less accurate, the attacker must increase the difficulty
of the combat check by \difficulty. The user may choose not
to use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case,
they cannot trigger the quality but also do not suffer
the aforementioned penalty.

If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Auto-fire
by spending \advantage\advantage. Auto-fire can be triggered multiple
times. Each time the attacker triggers Auto-fire, it deals
an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an
additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base
damage plus the number of \success on the check.
These additional hits can be allocated to the original
target, or to other targets within range of the weapon.
If the attacker wishes to hit multiple targets, they must
decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if
they wish to hit multiple targets, their initial target must
always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest
defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses
which is the initial target). The initial hit must always be
against the initial target. Subsequent hits generated can
be allocated to any of the other designated targets.
Auto-fire weapons can also activate one Critical Injury for
each hit generated on the attack, per the normal rules; the
Critical Injury must be applied to the target of the specific
hit.
