\subsubsection{Blast}
\label{iqty:blast}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or
a similar area of effect, like a detonated grenade or a
warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is
successful and Blast activates, each character (friend
or foe) engaged with the original target suffers a hit
dealing damage equal to the Blast quality’s rating, plus
damage equal to the total \success scored on the check.
In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Game Master
might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage.
If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still
detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the
firer (or quick reactions on the part of the targets) means
the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius.
However, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack
misses by spending \advantage\advantage\advantage. In
this case, the original target and every target engaged
with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage
equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.
