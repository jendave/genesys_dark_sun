\subsubsection{Disorient}
\label{iqty:disorient}
\textbf{Type:} Active\\
A weapon with Disorient can daze an opponent. When
Disorient is triggered, one target hit by the attack is
disoriented (see Genesys pg. 114) for a number of rounds equal
to the weaponâ€™s Disorient rating. A disoriented target
adds \setback to all skill checks they perform. If
multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Disorient,
the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a
different target each time.
