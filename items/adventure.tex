\paragraph{Backpack} \label{advitm:backpack}
Backpacks increase the characters encumbrance by 4.

\paragraph{Caltrops} \label{advitm:caltrops}
A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that
one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to
rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that
your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow
down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops
covers an area 5 feet square.\\
Each time a creature moves into an area covered by
caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in
such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make
an attack roll for the caltrops with no ranks, against the
creature. For this attack defense bonuses do not count. If
the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, add a
\setback. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a
caltrop. The target suffers 1 Wound, and the creature
applies the \textit{Hamstrung Critical (The target loses their
free maneuver until this critical is healed)}. This
Daunting (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty)
Brawn check upgrade the
movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the critical is
successfully treated, or until it receives at least 1 point
of magical healing.\\

the range, Medium range being its maximum range.

Ink in colors other than black costs twice as much.

\paragraph{Jug, Clay} \label{advitm:jug}

\paragraph{Lamp, Common} \label{advitm:lamp_common}

\paragraph{Manacles} \label{advitm:manacles}

the most dangerous of enemies or by the most rich slave- or
bounty-hunters.\\
Manacles can bind a Medium creature. To slip free, a
creature must roll a Formitable (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty)
Coordination Check.  Breaking the manacles requires a
Daunting (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty) Brawn check.
Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock
to the cost of the manacles.
For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small
creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times
the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100
times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny,
Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by
specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times
the indicated amount.
The checks to escape all get setbacks.

\paragraph{Oil, 1 pint flask} \label{advitm:oil}
A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern or lamp.
You can also use a flask of oil as a splash weapon.

\paragraph{Acid} \label{alcitm:acid}
You can throw a flask of acid as a weapon with an
Ranged light or Alchemy combat check with a base
damage of 6 acid damage, with a range of short, and
\nameref{iqty:blast} 3, \nameref{iqty:sunder}.

\paragraph{Alchemist's Fire} \label{alcitm:alchemistsfire}
You can throw a flask of alchemistâ€™s fire as a weapon
with an Ranged light or Alchemy combat check with
a base damage of 6 fire damage, with a range of short,
and \nameref{iqty:blast} 3, \nameref{iqty:burn} 2 .

\paragraph{Antitoxin} \label{alcitm:antitoxin}
If you drink a vial of antitoxin, you get an upgrade on
your Resilience check against poison for 1 hour.

\paragraph{Smokestick} \label{alcitm:smokestick}
This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates
thick, opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a
short range radius, The stick is consumed after 1 round,
and the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.\\
A creature that is engaged range with the fog adds
\setback on Perception, Vigilance, and all combat skill
checks. Creatures farther away looking or targetting into
the mist add \setback\setback to their Perception, Vigilance,
and all combat skill checks.

\paragraph{Tanglefoot Bag} \label{alcitm:tanglefootbag}
tanglefoot bag is a small sack filled with tar, resin
and other sticky substances. When you throw a
tanglefoot bag at a creature roll a Ranged Light or
Alchmey combat check. This attack has a range of

tindertwig is a maneuver (rather than an action), and
lighting any other fire with one is a maneuver.
