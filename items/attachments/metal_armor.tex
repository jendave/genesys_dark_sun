\subsubsection{Metal Armour}
This armour is reinforced by larges patches of metal in vulnerable places. Metal
being very precious as it is, the shining material will upgrade it's protective
layer, cost and the wearers' status. The weapon must be crafted with this 'attachment', it
cannot be added later.\\
\textbf{Use With:} This attachment can be applied to any armour with a soak rating above leather armour.\\
\textbf{Modifiers:} Metal Armour lose the \iqtyref{fragile} quality and adds the \iqtyref{superior} quality.
    In addition it takes \despair\despair to break a metal armour.
    However, metal armour is generally also more cumbersome. An armour with the Metal
    Armour qualifier adds 1 to its Encumbrance rating.\\
\textbf{Hard Points Required:} 2.\\
\textbf{Cost:} Cost x 2 + 2000cp.\\
\textbf{Rarity:} 10.\\
