"Be wary of the forest ridge. The halflings who live there
would as soon eat you alive as look at you. Chances are
you won't even notice them until you've become the main
course."

Halflings are masters of the jungles of the Ringing
Mountains. They are small, quick and agile creatures
steeped in an ancient and rich culture that goes back far
into Athas' past. Although they are not common in the
Tablelands, some halflings leave their homes in the forests
to adventure under the Dark Sun. As carnivores, halflings
prefer to eat flesh raw.\\

\textbf{Personality:}
Halflings have difficulty understanding
others' customs or points of view, but curiosity helps
some halflings overcome their xenophobia. Little
concerned with material wealth, halflings are more
concerned with how their actions will affect other
halflings.\\

\textbf{Names:} Halflings tend to have only one given name.\\
\textbf{Male Names:} Basha, Cerk, Derlan, Drassu, Entrok,
Kakzim, Lokee, Nok, Pauk, Plool, Sala, Tanuka, Ukos,
Zol.\\
\textbf{Female Names:} Alansa, Anezka, Dokala, Grelzen,
Horga, Jikx, Joura, Nasaha, Vensa.\\

\textbf{Roleplaying Suggestions:}
Remember to consistently take your height into
account. Role-play the halfling culture described above:
eating opponents, treating fellow halflings with trust and
kindness, suspicion of big people, and general lack of
interest in money.
