"The worst thing you can say to a dwarf is 'It can’t be done.'
If he's already decided to do it, he may never speak to you again. If he hasn't
decided to take up the task, he may commit himself to it simply out of spite.
'Impossible' is not a concept most dwarves understand. Anything can be done,
with enough determination."

Dwarves form a good part of the people encountered in the Tablelands. These
strong and devoted beings live to fulfill their focus, a task they choose
to devote their lives to. Stubborn and strong‐minded, dwarves make good
companions, even though their usual focused nature can tend to be bothersome.\\

\textbf{Personality:}
Dwarves prefer to occupy themselves with meaningful tasks,
and often approach these tasks with an intensity rarely seen in other races.
As such, dwarves make excellent laborers, and take great pride in their
accomplishments. However, their stubbornness can lead to difficulties.
Dwarves will sometimes fail to listen to reason, attempting to accomplish what
are impossible tasks. Dwarves live for their focus. Dwarves that die while
being unable to complete their focus return from the dead as banshees to
haunt their unfinished work. A dwarf also rarely divulges his focus to anyone.\\

\textbf{Names:} A dwarf’s name is usually granted to him by
his clan leader after he completes his first focus.\\
\textbf{Male Names:} Baranus, Biirgaz, Bontar, Brul, Caelum,
Caro, Daled, Drog, Fyra, Ghedran, Gralth, Gram, Jurgan,
Lyanius, Murd, Nati, Portek.\\
\textbf{Female Names:} Ardin, Erda, Ghava, Greshin, Gudak,
Lazra, N’kadir, Palashi, Vashara.\\

\textbf{Roleplaying Suggestions:}
Remember the intensity of your focus. Breaking or
ignoring a focus has social, philosophical and spiritual
repercussions. For someone to stand in the way of your
focus is an assault on you. There is no greater satisfaction
than fulfilling a difficult focus. Keep a serious, sober
attitude nearly always. The only time you show your
festive side is when you have recently fulfilled a focus,
during the hours or days until you set a new focus.
Only during these brief days of fulfillment, and only
to other dwarves and your most trusted non-Dwarven
friends, do you show your full joy and sense of humor.
But these days are also a time of vulnerability, for until
you set a new focus you lose all of your special focus
related bonuses.
