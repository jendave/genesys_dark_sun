Athas' deserts, plains, steppes and badlands are home
to the elves, a longâ€“limbed race of trading, raiding,
thieving sprinters. Running is the key to acceptance and
respect among elves. Elves that are injured and cannot
run are often left behind to die.\\

\textbf{Personality:}
Other races see elves as dishonest and
lazy; generally a fair assessment. Elves idle around their
time for days until compelled by need to exert themselves,
but they can run for days without complaint. No self-
respecting elf will consent to ride an animal. To do so is
dishonorable; Elven custom dictates that individuals keep
up or be left behind. Elves prefer to lead short, happy
lives rather than long, boring ones. Seeing the future as a
dark, deadly place, they prefer to live in "the now,"
enjoying each fleeting moment. They thrive in open
spaces, and tend to wither in captivity.\\

\textbf{Names:} Whether slave or free, elves prefer to keep
Elven names. Tribe members take the tribe name as
surname. Elves treat the naming of young runners as a
sacred responsibility, naming the children of the tribe
after the first interesting thing that they do while learning
to run. Elves believe with the appropriate name, a child
can grow to greatness, but with the wrong name, the elf
may vanish in the wastes. Sometimes a child's name is
changed because of an extraordinary deed performed
during an elf's rite of passage.\\
\textbf{Male Names:} Botuu (Water Runner), Coraanu (First
Elf, the Warrior Thief), Dukkoti (Wind Fighter), Haaku
(Two Daggers), Lobuu (First Runner), Mutami (Laughs at
Sun), Nuuko (Sky Hunter), Traako (Metal Stealer).\\
\textbf{Female Names:} Alaa (Bird Chaser), Ekee (Wild
Dancer), Guuta (Singing Sword), Hukaa (Fire Leaper),
Ittee (Dancing Bow), Nuuta (Quiet Hunter), Utaa
(Laughing Moon)\\
\textbf{Tribe (Clan) Names:} Clearwater Tribe (Fireshaper,
Graffyon, Graystar, Lightning, Onyx, Sandrunner,
Seafoam, Silverleaf, Songweaver, Steeljaw, Wavedivers,
Windriders clans); Night Runner Tribe (Dark Moons, Full
Moons, Half Moons, Lone Moons, New Moons, Quarter
Moons clans); Shadow Tribe; Silt Stalker Tribe (Fire Bow,
Fire Dagger, Fire Sword clans); Silver Hand Tribe; Sky
Singer Tribe (Dawnchaser, Dayjumper, Twilightcatcher
clans); Swiftwing Tribe; Water Hunter Tribe (Raindancer,
Poolrunner, Lakesinger clans); Wind Dancer Tribe
(Airhunter, Breezechaser clans)\\

\textbf{Roleplaying Suggestions:}
Rely on Elven combat skills (distance, bows, and
fighting by the light of the moons and stars). Use Elven
noncombat skills and philosophy (running, escape from
entangling situations or relationships). When someone
professes to be your friend, dismiss them at first and then
later, offer them a test of trust. Don't tell them that it is a
test, of course. Ask them to give you one of their prize
possessions, for example, or leave your own valuables out
and see if they take advantage of you. Pretend to sleep,
and find out what they say about you when they think
you are not listening. Some elves go as far as to allow
themselves to be captured to see if the presumed friend
will rescue them!
