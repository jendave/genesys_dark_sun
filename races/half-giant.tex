Legend has it that in ages past, a sorcerer‐queen used
wizardry to beget a union of giant and human in order to
create a race of powerful slaves. Whatever the truth of this
legend, the Half-Giant race has increased in number and is
now fairly common especially in human controlled lands
near the shore of the Sea of Silt. Half-Giants gain great
strength, but dull wits, from their giant heritage, and are
nearly as agile as their human forbearers.\\

\textbf{Personality:}
Because of their artificial origins, there is
no half‐giant culture, tradition or homeland. Half‐giants
readily imitate the customs and cultures of their
neighbors. Half-giants often display curiosity, a
willingness to learn, and a general tendency towards
kindness.\\

\textbf{Names:} Enslaved half-giants often have human
names, and because of this they vary greatly. Free half-
giants are likely to borrow the naming conventions of the
race or people they are imitating at the time their child is
born.\\

\textbf{Roleplaying Suggestions:}
Always remember how much bigger and heavier you
are than everyone else. Take advantage of your height in
combat, but remember the disadvantages. Between your
size and your lesser wits (even if you are a relatively
intelligent half‐giant people will assume you to be dull),
you find yourself an object of comic relief. You are used to
being teased and will endure more witty remarks than
most people, but when you have been pushed too far
your personality can suddenly shift, and you can unleash
astonishing violence on your tormentors and any who
stand in your way. Less frequently, these shifts can
happen to you without provocation - you just wake up
with a different ethos and altered disposition.
Remember you are influenced by powerful
personalities, and can shift your personality and ethics.
You tend to imitate the tactics, clothes and demeanor of
your 'little master.'
