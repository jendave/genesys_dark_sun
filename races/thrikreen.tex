Thri‐kreen are the strangest of the intelligent races of
the Tablelands. These insectoid beings possess a mindset
very different from any humanoid being encountered.
They roam the wastes in packs, hunting for food day and
night, since they require no sleep. Thri‐kreen are quick
and agile and make fearsome fighters, feared throughout
the wastes.\\

\textbf{Personality:}
Since Thri‐kreen (also known simply as
the kreen) do not require sleep, they have difficulty
understanding this need in the humanoid races. They
have difficulty understanding this state of "laziness" in
others. Other behaviors of humanoids seem unnecessarily
complex. A keen's life is simple: hunt prey. Kreen live for
the hunt, and own only what they can carry.\\

\textbf{Names:} Kachka, Ka'Cha, Ka'Ka'Kyl, Klik‐Chaka'da,
Sa'Relka, T'Chai\\

\textbf{Roleplaying Suggestions:}
You tend to rely on your natural attacks and special
kreen weapons. Everything you kill is a potential dinner.
You have a strong need for a party leader - obedience to
this leader in the party is important to you. If you seem to
be the most powerful and capable, then you will assume
leadership; if someone challenges your authority then you
will wish to test whether they are in fact stronger than
you. It is not a question of vanity; you won't want to fight
to the death, but merely to ascertain who is worthy to lead
the party. You do not have the focus of a dwarf to
complete a project, but you would give your life to protect
your companions. If you did not trust and honor them as
your own family, then you would not travel with them
and work together with them. You do not understand the
concept of sleep. It disturbs you that your dra companions
lie unconscious for a third of their lifetimes. You own only
what you can carry, caring little for money or other items
that other races consider as treasure. Your philosophy of
ownership sometimes leads you into conflict with
presumptuous dra who think they can own buildings,
land, and even whole herds of cattle!
