    Delmao, Half-Elven thief
}

Unlike the parents of muls, elves and humans are
often attracted to each other. Half‐elves are typically the
unwanted product of a casual interracial encounter.\\

\textbf{Personality:}
Half‐elves are notorious loners. Many
Athasians believe that half‐elves combine the worst traits
of both races, but the most difficult aspect of half‐elves -
their lack of self–confidence - comes not from their mixed
origins but rather from a life of rejection from both parent
races. Half‐elves try in vain to gain the respect of humans
or elves.\\

\textbf{Names:} Half‐elves nearly always have human names.
Unable to run as elves, they never receive Elven given
names, or acceptance in an Elven tribe that they could use
as surname.\\

\textbf{Roleplaying Suggestions:}
Desperate for the approval of either elves or humans,
you are even more desperate to appear independent and
self-reliant, to cover your desire for approval. As a result,
you tend towards a feisty, insecure, sullen self-reliance,
refusing favors. You take every opportunity to show off
your skills in front of elves and humans, but if an elf or a
human were to actually praise you, you would probably
react awkwardly or suspiciously. From your childhood,
your closest friendships have been with animals. Other
half‐elves do not interest you. As time goes by and you
learn from experience, you will find that you can also get
along with other races neither human nor Elven: dwarves,
muls, even thri-kreen. You don’t feel the terrible
need for their approval, and yet they give it more readily.
