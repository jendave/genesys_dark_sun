\epigraph{\textit{
    "I live in a world of fire and sand. The crimson sun scorches the life from anything that crawls or flies, and storms of sand
    scour the foliage from the barren ground. Lightning strikes from the cloudless sky, and peals of thunder roll unexplained
    across the vast tablelands. Even the wind, dry and searing as a kiln, can kill a man with thirst."
