%SandStorms
%Blowing sand can quickly turn into a nasty sandstorm. There are two types of sandstorms - mild and driving.
%Mild sandstorms last 1d20 rounds. On a roll of 20, a mild sandstorm becomes a driving sandstorm after 10 rounds.
%In a mild sandstorm, visibility is reduced (see DS Rules Book p. 84). In addition, movement must be reduced to
%half speed or the party risks getting lost. If the party does not reduce its rate of movement, the lead character
%(or animal driver) must make a Wisdom check every round the storm lasts to stay on course. Don't tell the players
%that this is what the roll is for because, if they fail, they should not know that they have gone the wrong way.
%How badly a party fails its Wisdom check determines how much time is added to their trek. In mild sandstorms,
%the difference translates into hours. For example, Azhul the Hasty leads the way through a mild sandstorm.
%His Wisdom is 10, but he rolls a 14. The party travels an extra four hours (14- 10 = 4).
%Driving sandstorms last 1d10 rounds. In a driving sandstorm, visibility is reduced and movement must be reduced
%to one-quarter speed to keep from getting lost. Wisdom checks are needed every round as described above, but
%these checks are made at +5. How badly the party fails determines how much time is added to travel in the
%form of days. For example, if Azhul, with his Wisdom of 10, rolls a 7, the party adds two days to their trek (7 + 5 - 10 = 2).

%Sandstorm effects
%Characters with the Weather Sense nonweapon proficiency should make four checks as the day progresses. Characters
%who succeed at least three times realize that a sandstorm is coming in time for the PCs to find shelter.
%Characters who succeed only two of the checks know that a sandstorm is imminent, but must endure the storm as
%best they can with minimum preparations. In this case, they can simply stay where they are or try to keep moving.
%Moving through a sand storm, even when prepared, is a tricky proposition. The lead character must reduce the
%party's movement to one-quarter speed or risk getting lost. A Wisdom check must be made with a -5 penalty.
%Success means the party stays on course. Failure indicates they get lost. How badly the check fails determines
%the number of days that must be added to the PC's trek. For example, if a character with a Wisdom of 12 leads
%the way through the sandstorm and rolls an 8, the party adds one day to its trek 8 + 5 - 12 = 1). Characters
%with the Direction Sense proficiency or Know Direction psionic talent suffer no penalties to their checks.
%Characters who succeed at only one check or less are caught by surprise when the sandstorm hits. In addition
%to possibly getting lost, the party also suffers the effects listed on the table below (DM rolls 1d100).
%
%1d100 Roll Effect
%01-40 Party manages to ride out the storm. Apart from exhaustion and possibly getting lost, no other effects.
%41-65 Party loses two pieces of equipment.
%66-80 Party loses two pieces of equipment plus 80% of its water.
%81-95 Every character and riding animal takes 2d6 damage and items are lost on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6.
%96-00 Every character and riding animal takes 4d6 damage and items are lost on a roll of 1-3 on 1d4. Every creature has a 4% chance of being buried alive.

%Wind and Sand
%
%Dehydration is not the only enemy for those journeying through the desert. High winds can lift sand and dust
%into a choking, blinding storm that can scour individuals as well as property. Characters trapped in such a
%storm without protection suffer 1d2 points of damage per round. In addition, they must make a saving throw vs.
%wands; those who fail are blinded (per the spell) for 1d6 turns. A tent or rock outcropping offers sufficient
%protection from the storm; so does lying prone with a cloth across the eyes, nose, and mouth. Further, the
%protection from normal missiles spell and similar magics can protect the individual unless the storm is magical
%in origin.
%In addition to inflicting the damage noted above, desert storms can bury characters alive, eventually causing
%them to suffocate. So can certain spells that trigger sandslides or move dunes. (See Chapter 8 for details on
%spells.) Characters who are buried alive by a desert storm can dig themselves out in 1d3 rounds. Those buried
%by an avalanche of sand — whether natural or caused by a spell — can dig free in 1d6 rounds unless otherwise
%noted in the spell description.
%Crawling out of a sandy grave is no simple task. For each round spent digging toward the surface, a character
%must make a Strength check as well as a Constitution check. A successful Strength check reduces the time
%required for escape by one round; failure has no effect. In contrast, a failed Constitution check results in
%the loss of 1d4 points of Constitution, while a successful Constitution check neither helps nor hinders the
%character. An individual reduced to 0 Constitution cannot move. If no help is forthcoming, the paralyzed
%character will suffocate in 1d10 rounds.
%A number of variables can delay or retard suffocation, however, including spells and magical items which
%reduce or eliminate the need to breathe. The endurance proficiency enables a character to make a Constitution
%check every other round instead of every round, but it does not affect the required Strength checks.
%Assuming they know where to dig, other characters can rescue an individual who has been buried alive. For
%every round in which they dig downward, wouldbe rescuers reduce the number of rounds required for escape by
%one. Excavating time is the same no matter how many characters dig. Rescuers can dig out an individual who
%has reached 0 Constitution, and is unable to move.
%Constitution lost while a character is buried alive is regained at 1 point per turn. Hit points are unaffected
%by Constitution lost in this fashion. Constitution may never be regained to a level higher than a character’s
%usual maximum.
