    I have heard tales that suits of clothing fashioned from metal have even been
    found from time to time. It is generally agreed that these were worn by
    warriors to protect against the blows of enemy weapons. I can only speculate
    that the climate must have been far cooler in those ancient days. Any fool
    that would wear such clothing now would die faster from heat stroke than he
    would have from the weapons of his foes. Still, the idea that there was once
    enough metal in the world to allow such a garment to have been manufactured
    astounds me.\\
    There are even rumors that mounds of steel, silver, and gold lie hidden in
    the deepest tunnels of certain forlorn cities. I have never seen such a thing
    myself, but if such treasures exist, they will reward those who find them most
    handsomely. Those who control such stores of metal can buy food, power,
    influence, and sometimes even the sorcerer-king’s protection.

\textit{Dark Sun} characters must be well equipped in order to endure the rigors of Athas.
This chapter covers a variety of topics related to mundane equipment that every
hero needs to survive and prosper.

\section{Equipping a Character}
\subsection{Money}
The default money unit is an \textit{Ceramic Piece} or \textit{cp}. This unit can be subdivided in
\textit{Ceramic Bits} (\textit{bit}) and \textit{Lead Bead (bd)}. Larger units are \textit{Silver Pieces} (\textit{sp}) and
\textit{Gold Pieces} (\textit{gp}).\\
\\
10,000 bd = 1,000 bits = 100 cp = 10 sp = 1gp.\\
\\
Ceramics are made from glazed clay and baked in batches once a year in a secure
process supervised by the high templar that supervises the city’s treasury. Bits
are literally one‐tenth parts of a ceramic piece—the ceramic pieces break easily
into ten bits. Some cities’ ceramic pieces have small holes that can be threaded
onto a bracelet or necklace. The lowest unit of Athasian trade is the lead bead
(bd).  In general, the Athasian economy in the cities is relatively stable thanks
to the Merchant Houses. Under normal conditions, supply is ample thanks to the
caravans traveling back and forth between the cities. However, for smaller
communities and trade outposts the price situation on certain goods can sway
drastically. A raider attack or sandstorm can result in lack of necessities such
as food and water, for which people will pay almost any amount of coin. Coins
are not the only means of exchange. Barter and trade in commodities is widespread.

\section{Rarity}\label{sec:equipment-rarity}

When selling an item, your character needs to make
a successful Negotiation check. Use the difficulty set by
the item's rarity (as determined by \tableref{equipment-rarity}).\\
\\
For the cost modifiers of selling an item, please refer to \tableref{trading-modifiers}

\end{GenesysTable}
\end{table}

\section{Item Qualities}\label{sec:item-qualities}
Some variety equipment and depth features to the weapons, special qualities
armor, and that items add your character may encounter. Item qualities are
special rules that can change how the item acts.

Special qualities are generally either passive or active. Passive qualities are
always "on" and require no activation on the part of the user. Active qualities
must be triggered by the user, often by spending one or more \advantage to
activate the effect.

Item qualities usually have a number associated with them. This is their rating.
Ratings affect qualities in different ways, depending on the quality in question.
Active qualities require \advantage\advantage to activate unless otherwise stated
in their description. Active item qualities on weapons can only trigger on a
successful attack, unless specified otherwise.

\subsection{Repairing Gear}\label{sec:repairing-gear}

As a general rule, Athasian items break with can break with spending either
\threat\threat\threat or \despair, instead of only on a \despair. Items with the
\iqtyref{superior} quality or made from metal are exempt from both rules.

\section{Item Attachments}

Item attachments are ways to customize weapons or armor. They include specialised
ways to upgrade or add features and to personalize your gear. Each item attachment
has a cost in ceramic pieces, and an cost in Hard Points.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsection{Hardpoints}
The number of hardpoints an item has is determined by its basic encumbrance value.
An item has an number of hardpoints equal to hald an items base enumbrance value
rounded up. Once an attachment is installed, the hardpoints cost of that attachment
is now considered 'in use' and cannot be used for other attachments unless the
attachment is removed.

\subsection{Installing Attachments}

Installing an attachment requires roughly an hour of work. In addition, the character
doing the installing needs to make a successful  Average (\difficulty\difficulty)
Crafting check. Failure simply means that the attachment isn't installed, and the
character needs to try again later. Failure with a \despair (not likely unless you
upgrade the check's difficulty) means that the character clumsily destroys the
attachment in the process! Success with \despair means that the installation is
successful, but the attachment may fall off or stop working at an awkward time,
depending on the item and attachment involved.

\section{Selling and Trading}\label{chap:sec:trading}

This Section is extremely experimental.\\
\\
In some cases, the PCs might wish to engage in trade, buying multiple items at one
location and then selling them at another location where they are rarer. We generally
advise that you handle this narratively. However, if your GM wishes to use some
mechanical guidelines for this process, we’ve provided some basic rules that cover trading.\\
\\
Trade works the same whether with black-market items or with legal items. Selling
either type of item follows the rules listed previously with the caveat that trading
in legal items requires a Negotiation check, while trading in illegal items requires a
Streetwise check. However, when determining the sell price based on the success of the
Negotiation or Streetwise check, first multiply the cost of the item by the difference
between the item's rarity where it was bought and its rarity where it is to be sold,
referring to \tableref{equipment-rarity-modifiers} and \tableref{equipment-rarity-costs}.
Then take the new, increased cost and determine the sell price by the results of the
Negotiation or Streetwise check.\\
\\
Of course, these rules do not account for all sorts of details, such as buying in bulk,
marketing and advertising, and myriad other factors that may affect prices.\\
\\
This is why the rules for buying, selling, and trading are all modifiable by the GM and
subject to their judgement. It is also important to note that these rules only apply when
engaging in commercial trade. So, if your group sells a load of guns in a town, then
later your character buys one of those guns in that town, they’re going to have to pay
usual, listed price for the gun. The final thing to remember is that your GM always has the
final say on what can be sold, where it can be sold, and how much it can be sold for.
Because this isn't likely to be a major part of the game, we deliberately made a system
that is simple and doesn't account for a lot of the variables that would normally matter
when trying to sell an item.
