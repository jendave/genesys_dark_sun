\section{Vehicles}

Chariots and wagons are common vehicles in the
cities and caravans of Athas. Pulled by mekillots,
gargantuan or larger wagons serve as mobile
palaces for the wealthy. Vehicles grant protection
from the blistering sun and carry necessary
supplies hidden from greedy eyes. Certain
specialized conveyances are the only means to
cross a given landscape, such as the Sea of Silt.

    Chariots are two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two or
    four horses, used in ancient cultures as transportation
    for the nobility and for warfare and racing. Despite
    depictions in popular cinema, most war chariots served
    as mobile archery platforms for nobles, not as blade-covered
    battering rams.

    Rulebook) all other vehicles and characters involved in the collision add +30 to the
    results of any Critical Hit or Critical Injury they suffer.

%\Vehicle[name=Giant Wagen, price=1000, rarity=4, silhouette=2, maxspeed=2, handling=-1, defense=0, armour=0, ht_threshold=3, ss_threshold=3]
%{
%    This gigantic enclosed wagon is used both for
%    war and for trade. Inside its enclosed walls,
%    goods or troops can be carried protected from the
%    elements and raiders. An argosy has six mounted
%    crossbows on both side of its upper, open deck.
%    The soldiers on the upper deck get improved
%    cover against attackers on the ground. The
%    interior space can be prepared to accommodate
%    goods, military material, or passengers. A fully
%    loaded argosy can be pulled overland at 2 miles
%    an hour by a team of two mekillots.

%{
%    This is your average caravan cart, used for
%    trading. In Athas, these are walled up with woodto protect from raiders, have a platform at the topfor controlling the slaves or beasts and surveying
%    the terrain. Tents of hide provide shade for the
%    travelers. It is usually pulled by one mekillot orby a team of ten slaves (usually Muls). They
%    have huge, solid wheels and can tackle most
%    terrain apart from rocky fields and massive sanddunes.

%{
%    This light, wedge-shaped vehicle has three
%    wheels and a single sail. Propelled by the wind,
%    sand skiffs make excellent speed in salt flats,
%    stony barrens, sandy wastes, and dry savanna.
%    They can also manage gentle hills. Sand skiffs
%    do not navigate soft sand, boulder fields, steep
%    hills, or thick brush well.

%{
%    The typical salt skimmer features a broad hull
%    and outsized wheels. It rides 10 feet above the
%    ground and is powered by two large sails. The
%    vehicle can also be driven slowly, using muscle-
%    powered capstans to rotate its wheels. A salt
%    skimmer is most efficient in flat, open terrain,
%    but it can also make its way through silt or dust
%    sinks up to 15 feet deep.

%{
%    This four-wheeled chariot is made of stiffened
%    leather stretched over a frame of wooden beams,
%    the wooden spokes of the wheels protected by a
%    leather overlay. The frame, which is protected in
%    the front by reinforcing bone or chitin plates,
%    support a large chitin roof above the chariot.
%    Used as harassment and elite shock elements for
%    the sorcerer-kingsâ€™ armies, heavy war chariots
%    are often used against massed infantry formation.
%    A team of four crodlu, harnessed in two pairs,
%    can pull the chariot.
