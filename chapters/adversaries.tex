\epigraph{\textit{
    "To survive, almost every form of life has become a monster in one sense or another. These adaptations have taken an
    almost diabolical turn. Because the world is so barren, to some extent every creature is both predator and prey.
    Be cautioned, traveler. For even the most passive beast and sweetest flower is often deadly on Athas. In a world where
    creatures must kill or be killed, this is only logical. Still, many people forget this rule when they see a brightly
    colored plant or a seemingly friendly ball of scales roll by." } } {The Wandererâ€™s Chronicle}
