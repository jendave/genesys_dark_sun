\section{Turns}
\subsection{Manouvers}
Maneuvers are activities that aren’t complex enough to
warrant a skill check, but still involve time and effort
on the part of a character. Characters are allowed one
maneuver during their turn, and certain circumstances
may allow them a second maneuver as well, such as spending two \advantage.
The following are some examples of maneuvers:
\begin{description}
    \item Aiming a weapon (\boost per aim maneuver).
    \item Assisting an ally (Add \boost to that characters specific check per ally helping).
    \item Moving one range band closer or farther away from an enemy.
    \item Opening a door.
    \item Diving behind cover.
    \item Flipping over a table.
    \item Standing up or dropping prone.
    \item Mount or dismount.
    \item Guarded Stance. (gain \setback and Melee Defense +1 until the end of their next turn)
\end{description}

\subsection{Actions}
Actions are important activities that are vital to a character's accomplishment
of a goal. Each character may normally only perform one action during their
turn, likely the most important activity they undertake during their turn.
Actions almost always involve performing a skill check, although certain
character abilities may require using an action to activate them.

The following are some examples of actions:
\begin{description}
    \item Unlocking a locked door.
    \item Shooting a bow
    \item Punching or grappling an opponent.
    \item Instructing allies with a series of orders.
    \item Performing first aid on an ally.
    \item Sneaking up on a vigilant foe.
    \item Climbing a cliff.
\end{description}
Out of all of these options, the most common during combat are those that
involve attacking an opponent. Attacking an opponent requires a combat
skill check, sometimes referred to in shorthand as a combat check or
simply an attack.
