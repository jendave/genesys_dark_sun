    "The Tablelands are a giant wasteland, to the untrained eye barren and devoid of life. When people see plants wither and
    die when someone utters mysterious phrases accompanied by unknown gestures, they assume the worst. They cry wizard
    and the mob instantly gathers to kill him. But if people venture into the wastes and look under the rocks, they will learn
    that Athas is teeming with all sorts of life. And when the vermin swarm forth to envelop them, biting and crawling into
    every orifice, do they see the irony?" } } { The Oracle, Blue Shrine Scrolls }

\section{Magical Manouvers}
To use these manouvers, the character has to have atleast 1 rank in either
an Arcane or an Primal skills and have a talent allowing them to use that
skill to cast spells.

\subsection{Counterspell}
Most skilled mages or spellcasters can attempt to counter an opponent’s spells
as they are being cast. If the character performs the counterspell maneuver,
all opponents within medium range upgrade the difficulty of checks to cast
spells once, until the end of the character's next turn.

\subsection{Concentrate}
Some magical effects might require concentration to sustain. If a magical action
(or spell) can benefit from concentration, the action description notes this.
Spells that can be sustained through concentration last until the end of the
character's next turn (as noted in their description). However, if the character
performs the concentrate maneuver during that next turn, the spell’s effects last
until the end of the character’s following turn, instead. This can be sustained
indefinitely by performing the concentrate maneuver each turn.

\section{Arcane}
Characters can only use one of the Arcane skills to cast a spell if they have a talent
allowing such use. Each spell has various options to raise the overal difficulty
of the check, in exchange for various benefits. The overal difficulty of
such a check can never be raised beyond (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty),
after reductions. Casting a spell costs 2 Strain. In addition, when casting an
arcane spell the user adds a number of \force die equal to the ranks of the skill
used in the spell. Any one \darklight thrown during the skill check can be used to
substitute a \advantage, and \darklight\darklight\darklight can be used to substitute
a \success.\\
However, using \light cost an extra Strain, simulating the extra energy used from
within and \dark used during casting constitude the use of Defiling magic. The GM
is encouraged to narrate this effect on the environment and it is certainly possible
that there are actual consequences for its use, with more \darklight constituting
greater defilement. People will notice defiling magic, especially when it is used
often or a lot \darklight is used at once.

Finally Arcane magic can use Spell Components to enhance the potenty of their spells
or reduce their difficulty. (See \cref{itmmgc:spellcomponentpouch} for more information).

\paragraph{Preserving}
\textbf{Preserving} is when an arcane spell is cast without using any \dark, regardless of the number of \light used.
Talents requiring preserving can thus be only used when the caster does not use any \dark in the casting of that spell.

\paragraph{Defiling}
\textbf{Defiling} is when an arcane spell is cast using atleast one \dark, regardless of the number of \light used.
Talents requiring defiling can thus only be used when the caster uses atleast any \dark.

\section{Primal}

As with Arcana, Characters can only use one of the Primal skills to cast a spell if they
have a talent allowing such use. Each spell has various options to raise the overal
difficulty and the use of Primal Spell Components can be used to enhance the potenty
of their spells or reduce their difficulty. (See \cref{itmmgc:spellcomponentpouch}
for more information). Primal Castes do not use \force dice.

\section{Psionics}
Your rank in the Psionics skill determines your psionics rating.
When using a psionics power, you roll a number of \force die equal to your
psionics rating. You can use \darklight to enhance your psionics power,
using \light is free, however \dark points show that you have a harder time,
if you want to use \dark points, you lose 1 Strain for each \dark point you
use.\\
\\
In contrast to the Arcana and Primal skills, anyone with one or more ranks
in Psionics can buy and use a Psionics Power, as listed below.\\
