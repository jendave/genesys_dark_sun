When your character gains this talent, decide on a signature spell for them, consisting of a particular magic action and a specific set of one or more effects. When your character casts their signature spell (consisting of the exact combination of action and effects previously chosen), reduce the difficulty of the check by one. When you take a new rank of this talent, you may also redefine your Signature Spell.
