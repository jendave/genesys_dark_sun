    Once per scene, as an action, you may change into a non-humanoid Minion level
    adversary. Your equipment melds with you but is unusable, you cannot speak nor
    cast spells, but you can use psionics. You do not gain of its abilities, but
    any ability you have you can still use. For the cost of one Destiny Point you
    may use one ability for the duration.  For example, for one Destiny Point you
    may gain flight when changing into an Kestrekel. You do gain its natural Soak and
    wounds. You suffer 1 strain per round, but can change back as a free action.
    When you pass out due to insufficient strain, you refert back to your original
    form. You can only change into creatures you have encountered.  When you have
    two ranks, you can change into a Rival, staying into an rival costs 2 strain
    per round, but you can stay into a Minion form without suffering strain. When
    you have three ranks of Shapeshifter you can change into a Nemesis, for which
    you suffer 4 strain per round.
