Clairsentience
Clairsentience powers enable a character to learn secrets long forgotten, to
glimpse the immediate future and predict the far future, to find hidden
objects, and to know what is normally unknowable. A psion who specializes
in clairsentience is known as a seer, and is most akin to an arcane diviner.
In 3rd edition, Clairsentience is linked to Wisdom.
