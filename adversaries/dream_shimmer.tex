    % description
    The dream shimmer is a large, winged insect with a thorax
    and abdomen similar in size to a small rodent. Its name
    comes from the sparkling glow of its wings, which seem to
    shimmer in any light. The dream shimmerâ€™s sole means of
    defense is a stinger containing hallucinogenic venom. This
    evolutionary adaptation gives the shimmer enough time to
    flee from danger or to continue to deliver repeated stun
    attacks with its stinger.
