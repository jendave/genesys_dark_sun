    % description
    \textit{
        This enormous lizard dwarfs you with its sheer bulk. Thirty
        feet long and covered with a thick shell, it lumbers forward with
        a plodding inevitability.

    Mekillots are used as caravan beasts; a hitched pair
    can pull a full wagon at a slow pace. Mekillots are never
    truly tamed, however, for the creatures have been known
    to go off the road and wander for days. They also like to
    make snacks of their handlers. Most caravans that use
    mekillots have a small team of psions to deal with the
    beasts.\\
