    % description
    \textit{
        This horrific beast looks like a twisted cross between a spider
        and a tortoise. From its huge bulbous head grow three large,
        feather‐like antennae, six compound eyes, and a pair of powerful
        mandibles. Its body is six feet in diameter and covered by a
        scaly, rust‐orange shell. Six four‐jointed legs ending in webbed
        feet sprout from beneath the shell.
    }\\
    \\
    Gaj are carnivores and require flesh to survive, but
    they also need to consume the mental energy of other
    sentient creatures to live.\\
    \\
    A gaj uses psionic dominate to compel its prey to come
    within range of its mandibles. Once the gaj has the
    creature in its grip, it will wrap one of its antennae around
    the victimʹs head and begin to damage the creature's
    intelligence.\\
    If forced into melee combat, the gaj uses its mandibles
    along with its painful strike power against its attackers.
    Anyone within reach will also be subject to attacks from
    its antennae and its Intelligence‐damaging ability.
