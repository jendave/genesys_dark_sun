    % description
    \textit{
        This creature is a small, reptilian humanoid with long,
        spindly arms and legs, a coiling tail and a long neck
        surmounted by a narrow, muzzled head. It is covered in scales
        that seem to be colored in deliberate patterns.
    }\\
    \\
    Jozhals are small, lightly built reptilian creatures
    which may be distantly related to crodlu.\\
    \\
    Jozhals avoid combat if at all possible, fleeing or using
    their chameleon‚Äêlike skin to hide. If forced into combat, a
    jozhal will attempt to defend itself first with psionics or
    spells, then with any magical items it currently possesses.
    If left with no other option, the jozhal will attack with a
    bite.
