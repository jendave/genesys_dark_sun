    % description
    Small, squat, and pugnacious, a jhakar has keen
    senses and a vicious streak. These traits make jhakars
    exceptional guards and hunting beasts, though
    no training can ever make them safe to handle. They
    respect strength and pain, but also nurse grudges. If
    a master ever lets down his or her guard, a jhakar is
    quick to strike.
