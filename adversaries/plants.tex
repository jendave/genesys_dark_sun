    The Blossomkiller is a very unique plant found in all the vegetated
    areas of Athas. The plant has many different features, including
    its stalk, roots, tendrils, and flowers.

    A single blossomkiller plant occupies an area with a radius of
    up to 15 meter. The roots and vines of this plant stretch across the
    area, between, in, and around any other nearby plants. The
    stalk of a blossomkiller is the size of a large tree trunk, but as it
    grows it lays flat down on the ground, where it spreads out in all
    directions.

    When a victim steps on any of the plants roots, the flowers shoot a
    spray of quills in all directions, entirely covering the area occupied
    by the plant. The quills carry on them a natural paralysis poison, and
    any creature or being hit by them is affected by \nameref{poison:blossomkiller}.
    Those who succeed take 2 points of Strain, but are otherwise unaffected.
