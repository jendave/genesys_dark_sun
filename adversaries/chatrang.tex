    \textit{
        The parched travelers finally catch sight of a small,
        reedy oasis. One of their number, versed in nature magic,
        follows the course of a desert hawk. As the group descends
        the side of a small mesa, a sharp screech pierces the air.
        Their bird guide flaps its wings in panic as it is pulled
        into a patch of what looks like bamboo. It disappears with
        a crunch.

    Slow and cowardly, chathrangs live and travel in groups of three.
    They make their homes near sources of plentiful prey, sharing the
    food they capture with other predators in exchange for protection.
    Training a Chn'thrang is difficult and rarely worth the effort,
    though dune traders and assassins sometimes keep the creatures to
    harvest the toxin they secrete. Captive chathrangs aren't reliable
    guards, but they might become agitated and attack in chaotic situations.\\
    \\
    Chn'thrang aren't smart. They use their tethers to poison and drag
    prey to them without stopping to consider that a captured creature
    might be dangerous. They prefer to attack flying enemies instead of
    those on the ground.\\
    \\
    As it waits for prey to approach, a chathrang digs a shallow burrow
    in which it hides with only its spines visible, so that it looks
    like a pile of broken reeds or bamboo. When hurt, a chathrang
    instinctively hides inside its bony shell.
