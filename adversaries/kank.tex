        This creature is a large insect with a black, chitinous
        exoskeleton and long, waving antennae. Its body is divided into
        a head, thorax and abdomen, and it has a pair of curved
        mandibles with which it produces a curious clicking noise.

    With powerful mandibles and a poisonous bite,
    soldier kanks are the warriors of their hive. When
    domesticated, soldier kanks are often used as caravan
    mounts, as they can travel for a full day at top speed
    while carrying a tremendous amount of weight for their
    size.\\
    \\
    A soldier is the first line of defense for the hive. A
    soldier strikes with its pincers when in combat and tries to
    get a hold. A soldiers bite is poisonous.

    Many kanks roam wild across the Tablelands, as well
    as being herded. These large, docile insects have black
    chitinous exoskeletons, which are divided into three
    sections: head, thorax, and abdomen. They can carry
    objects with their multiâ€“jointed pincers, or use them in
    combat.\\
    \\
    A worker only goes into combat when all the soldiers
    are dead or it is backed up into a corner. Workers strike
    with their pincers when in combat and try to get a hold.
