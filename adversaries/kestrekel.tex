    % description
    The scourge of the Tablelands, kestrekel are vile avian
    creatures that feast upon desert carrion. Although they
    are weak and cowardly in small groups, kestrekel can
    become a devas tating force in larger numbers.\\
    Kestrekel are fairly scrawny in appearance, with black
    plumage graying from the constant exposure. The only
    spot of appreciable color is found on the head, where
    the vivid crim son stands out like the blood it resembles.
    Standing barely a foot tall on short, taloned feet,
    kestrekel are extremely vul nerable on the ground. In
    the air however, their 3-foot wing span is more than
    enough to carry it aloft.\\
    Kestrekel communicate among themselves through calls
    and guttural squawks. They make no attempt to learn other
    languages.
