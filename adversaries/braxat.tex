    Braxats are hunters, and they fight like them. They use
    psionics to disable their opponents, thereby reducing risks
    to themselves. After attacking with psionics braxats will
    move in as close as they can while still being able to keep
    their opponents within their reach. Braxats have a breath
    weapon as well that they can employ, but they use it as a
    last resort since the acid can cause their prey to become
    inedible.
