    % description
    Horrifying creatures said to come from the Lands
    Within the Wind, sand brides are twisted creatures
    once strongly tied to arcane magic but now corrupted
    by the defilement of Athas. Sand brides were once
    vibrant and benevolent fey creatures, but the exile
    from their slowly disintegrating homeland has driven
    them to madness.\\

        Illusion check to change a small area up to medium range into difficult terrain.\\
    \textbf{- Sand Drown: } The Bride can control the sands around her to let it swallow her foes.
        She can make a Hard (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty) Arcana Attack check to let the sands
        swallow a character up to Medium Range. This attack deals 4 damage, plus 1 for any additional
        success, and has critical rating 3. In addition it has the \iqtyref{ensnare} 1 Quality.\\
        If an character is hit two turns in a row with this attack and the ensnare quality, it is
        being swallowed by the sand and takes 2 additional crushing damage plus 1 for each additional
        round. This damage can be prevented if another player succeeds in an Average Athletics
        (\difficulty\difficulty) check to pull the player out, in which case the 'timer' is reset.\\
