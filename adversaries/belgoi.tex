        When seen from a distance, this creature appears human,
        but its blue skin, clawed hands and webbed, three‚Äêtoed feet
        soon give it away. The creature has no teeth, no visible
        ears, and its hair is black and stringy.

    Belgoi are a race of savage humanoids that live in the
    most desolate of places, since no other race will allow
    them nearby. Belgoi seem to revel in destruction, and are
    considered to be second only to the defilers in the damage
    they do to the world around them.\\
    \\
    The weakest belgoi are cowardly, craven, creatures that
    rely on their stronger kin for cover and aid. They seek
    to gang up on wounded or isolated foes.\\
    \\
    Belgoi attempt to use the cover of darkness to mask
    their attacks. Usually, when attacking a group of
    creatures, they use their \textit{psionic dominate} power
    to draw a single individual away from the main group, to
    a place where they can use their Strength damage ability
    uninterrupted. They then attempt to draw out the next
    creature, and so on, until they feel confident that they
    can overcome the rest of the group without loss.\\
    If forced into melee combat, the belgoi use claws so
    they can use their Strength damage ability, and usually
    will not use weapons. When a battle turns against the
    belgoi, they retreat and return later with reinforcements.
    Only by killing the entire raiding party can a battle with
    the belgoi be prevented from turning into a long running
    engagement lasting for days.

        Slinking through the wastes alone, a belgoi stalker
