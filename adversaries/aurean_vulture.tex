    % description
    Aurean vultures are a large sentient, avian species of vulture-like
    creatures. Possessing wings of over 4 meters in length, they lived
    in the planet's deserts where they stayed adrift on warm updrafts
    until, using their brilliant eye sight, they spotted prey. The
    vultures will then pursue their target as a flock, for days at a
    time if necessary, after which, at the height of day, they swoop
    down at the angle of the sun to attack. They use the sun in the
    hope that there prey, which could include sentients, would be
    blinded and unable to fight back effectively. Aurean vultures
    would use their beaks and talons to attack.
