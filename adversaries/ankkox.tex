    An ankkox was a large ungulate native to Haruun Kal
    and domesticated as a riding mount for the Korunnai na-
    tives of that planet. The largest animals on the planet, they
    were twice as big as grassers, or about 1.5 times as big
    as a bantha, but lower and wider. They had shelled hides,
    splayed feet, and three pairs of side-mounted legs. Their
    orange-gold eyes were the size of a Human head, and their
    armored-beaked heads were the size of landspeeders.\\
    They were heavily armored except for the tail, which
    was highly flexible. At the end of its tail, there was a thick
    ball of armor, called a “tail mace.” These tail maces were
    taken from young ankkox by the Korunnai to use in herd-
    ing grassers. An adult ankkox could snap its tail mace so
    quickly that it could not be seen by Human eyes, but with
    enough power to shatter a tree.
