        Standing hunched before you is a vaguely reptilian
        humanoid with hairless, greenish‐gray skin and jet black lidless
        eyes. With clawed hands and feet and a fanged pronounced
        underbite, the creature’s appearance is rendered all the more
        strange by its bowlegged waddling gait.

    Gith combat tactics usually involve ambushes. They
    prefer to have a distinct advantage in numbers, and so
    attack in mass. Their weapon of choice is an obsidian
    spear designed for chopping and slashing rather than
    piercing, but they will use any weapon they have access
    to. They disdain the use of range weapons, since they
    enjoy watching the pain and fear of their opponents.
