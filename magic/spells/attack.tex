\subsubsection{Attack}
\fxnote{\currentname: Check and perhaps rephrase this.}
\textbf{Skill:} Arcane Attack\\
\textbf{Concentration:} No\\
\textbf{Basic Difficulty:} \textbf{Easy:} (\difficulty)\\
Magic attacks are cast spell checks but additionally follow the normal rules for
performing combat checks. When making a magic attack the character must select
one target at short (but not enganged) range. The attack deals damage equal to
the casters Intellect plus one per uncancelled \success. The attack has no
critical rating, so you may only inflict a Critical Injury with a \triumph.
Before making a magical attack, you may choose any number of additional effects
from~\tableref{magic-attack}.
