\difficulty                         & \textbf{Range:} Increase the range of the spell (the

                                        spend \advantage\advantage to extend the
                                        range band by one (and may trigger this

                                        additional sensory effect that appears in

                                        creature outside the area.\\
\difficulty\difficulty              & \textbf{Disguise:} The spell alters the target's
                                        entire appearance, either physically or
                                        by adding/subtracting clothing, gear,
                                        personal effects, or other. You may spend

                                        sounds or smells. Nothing this spell creates
                                        has a physical component, so objects pass
                                        through it as normal, and any creature that
                                        touches it will feel nothing.\\
\difficulty\difficulty              & \textbf{Massive Size:} The spell creates an illusion up

                                        \triumph on any Stealth checks it makes for
                                        as long as concentration is maintained. You
                                        may spend \advantage\advantage to render all
                                        sounds the target makes inaudible.\\

\subsubsection{Illusion}
\textbf{Skill:} Arcane Illusion\\
\textbf{Concentration:} Yes\\
\textbf{Basic Difficulty:} \textbf{Easy:} (\difficulty)\\
Arcane spellcasters can influence the mind of a target, causing
it to see, hear, or smell something that is not there. Likewise, they can cause
the target to not see, hear, or smell something.  The characters selects up to
three targets in short range, then makes either an Arcana or Divine skill check.
If the check is successful, the targets either sees a single static image up to
a size of silhouette 2, hears a sound ranging from a whisper to a scream emanating
from close range, or smells something wafting from close range. Likewise, the spell
can cause the target to be unable to see a small, static object with silhouette 1
such as a chest, weapon, door, or shelf. Before making an Illusion check, choose
any number of additional effects from ~\tableref{magic-illusion}.
