Cost                    & Effect\\
\difficulty             & \textbf{Additional Summon:} The spell summons one additional
                            item, weapon, or creature. In addition, after casting
                            the spell, you may spend \advantage\advantage to
                            summon one additional item, weapon, or creature (and
                            may trigger this multiple times, spending
                            \advantage\advantage each time).\\
\difficulty             & \textbf{Medium Summon:} The character may summon a more
                            complicated tool with moving parts, a rival no larger
                            than silhouette 1, or a two-handed melee weapon.\\
\difficulty             & \textbf{Range:} Increase the range of the spell (the distance
                            from the character that the summoned item or creature
                            appears) by one range band. This may be added multiple
                            times, increasing the range by one range band each time.\\
\difficulty             & \textbf{Summon Ally:} The creature the character summons is
                            friendly to them and obeys their commands. The character
                            may spend a maneuver to direct the creature, allowing
                            them to determine its action and maneuver. (If the
                            character summons multiple creatures, the character
                            may spend one maneuver on their turn to direct the
                            turns of all summoned creatures.)\\
\difficulty\difficulty  & \textbf{Grand Summon:} The character may summon a rival of up to
                            silhouette 3.\\

\subsubsection{Conjure}
\textbf{Skill:} Primal\\
\textbf{Concentration:} Yes\\
This action represents the ability of a spellcaster to ani-
mate objects or create items (or even allies) out of thin
air and the aether. The character makes a
Primal skill check. The default difficulty for the check is
Easy (\difficulty). If the check is successful, the character
summons a simple tool with no moving parts (such as a
shovel or pickax), a one-handed melee weapon with no
moving parts (such as a sword or knife), or a minion
no bigger than silhouette 1 (such as an animal, magical
creature, elemental spirit, or even undead mon
strosity). These appear engaged with the character. The
summoned minion or item remains present until the
end of the characterâ€™s next turn.
If the character summons a creature, the creature
behaves in the best approximation of its natural instincts
(as determined by the GM). It is not controlled by the
character, and may even be hostile to them. In a structured
encounter, it takes its turn immediately after the character.
Before making an Conjure check, you may choose any number of
additional effects from ~\tref{table:magic_conjure}.
