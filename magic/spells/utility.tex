\subsubsection{Cantrip}
\textbf{Skill:} Arcane\\
\textbf{Concentration:} Yes\\
\textbf{Difficulty:} \textbf{Easy:} (\difficulty)\\
Cantrips covers all the minor things that we expect
people to be able to do with magic, such as levitating a
book, transmuting a pebble into a butterfly, detecting
something magical nearby, summoning a ghostly light
source to see in the dark, or making one’s voice growl
with distant thunder. Basically, these are all cool abilities
with a minor benefit, but are more tricks than dangerous
or powerful magics. That doesn’t mean a player can't fig-
ure out how their character can use a utility spell to their
best advantage—that’s half the fun of being a spellcaster!

Cantrips don't have an equivalent action for
structured encounters, since the effects are almost
entirely narrative in nature. A check to cast a utility spell
should always be Easy (\difficulty). If that check seems too easy
for what you want to accomplish, then what you want to
do is probably beyond the scope of the cantrips!
