\subsubsection{Dispel}
\textbf{Skill:} Arcane\\
\textbf{Concentration:} No\\
The ability to nullify magic is a strange and wondrous
art that only certain arcane spellcasters possess. The
character selects one target within short range that
is under the effects of a spell, then makes an Arcana
 skill check. The default difficulty for the check is Hard
(\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty). If the check is successful,
the effects the target is under immediately end (if the spell
affected multiple targets, the other targets remain affected).
Before making a dispel check, choose any number of additional
effects from ~\tref{table:magic_dispel}.
