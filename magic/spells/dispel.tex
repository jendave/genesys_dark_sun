\textbf{Skill:} Arcane\\

\textbf{Basic Difficulty:} \textbf{Hard:} (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty)\\
The ability to nullify magic is a strange and wondrous
art that only certain arcane spellcasters possess. The
character selects one target within short range that
is under the effects of a spell, then makes an Arcana
skill check.  If the check is successful, the effects the
target is under immediately end (if the spell affected
multiple targets, the other targets remain affected).
Before making a dispel check, choose any number of
additional effects from ~\tableref{magic-dispel}.
