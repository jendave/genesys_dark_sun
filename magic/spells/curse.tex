\begin{GenesysTable}{l X}
Cost                               & Effect\\
\difficulty                        & \textbf{Enervate:} If a target suffers strain for any
                                        reason, they suffer 1 additional strain.\\
\difficulty                        & \textbf{Misfortune:} After the target makes a check,
                                        you may change one \boost to a face displaying a \threat.\\
\difficulty                        & \textbf{Range:} Increase the range of the spell by one
                                        range band. This may be added multiple times,
                                        increasing the range by one range band each time.\\
\difficulty\difficulty             & \textbf{Additional Target:} The spell affects one
                                        additional target within range of the
                                        spell. In addition, after casting the
                                        spell, you may spend \advantage to affect
                                        one additional target within range of the
                                        spell (and may trigger this multiple times,
                                        spending \advantage each time).\\
\difficulty\difficulty             & \textbf{Despair:} The target's strain and wound thresholds
                                        are reduced by an amount equal to the
                                        character’s ranks in Knowledge. This effect
                                        may not be combined with the additional
                                        target effect.\\
\difficulty\difficulty             & \textbf{Doom:} After a target makes a check, you may
                                        change any one die in the pool not displaying
                                        a \failure or \triumph to a different face.\\
\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty  & \textbf{Paralyzed:} The target is staggered for the
                                        duration of the spell. This affect may not
                                        be combined with the additional target effect.\\

\subsubsection{Curse}
\textbf{Skill:} Primal\\
\textbf{Concentration:} Yes\\
This action represents the combat use of curse magic. Your
character selects one target within short range, then makes
an Arcana or Divine skill check. The default difficulty of
the check is Average (\difficulty\difficulty). If it is successful, until the
end of the character’s next turn, the target decreases the
ability of any skill checks they make by one (in effect, this
means they remove one \proficiency from their checks).
 
Before making an Curse check, you may choose any number of
additional effects from ~\tref{table:magic_curse}.
