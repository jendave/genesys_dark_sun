# Dark Sun for the Genersys RPG

This is my attempt to port the setting of Dark Sun to the genesys RPG.

## Rationale

This book was mostly build with my group and me in mind. This means it was made with the following ideas in mind:
 - No previous experience with the setting; thus they should have ample oppertunity to read up on the setting.
 - Previous experience with the Star Wars or Genesys system. Thus there is no basic intro to the system it self.
 - Upgrading your character should be easy and quick, without having to read through a bunch of talents. This is why I kept the talent trees from Star Wars.
 - An abbrieviated version of most of the rules are copied in this document, for easy access for both players and GM.

## Files

This repository contains the Latex source code, and will result in the following files:
 - dark_sun_rpg.pdf
 - dark_sun_rpg_swgdice.pdf
 - ds_races.pdf
 - ds_specs.pdf
 - character_sheet.pdf

dark_sun_rpg.pdf and dark_sun_rpg_swgdice.pdf are the core rules with Genesys dice and Star Wars dice symbols respectively. ds_races.pdf is a print friendly pdf of only the races and ds_specs.pdf is a print friendly version of the specialisation trees.
Finally character_sheet.pdf is a custom character sheet for this setting.

## Installing prerequisites

Use install_text.sh to install all the prerequisites on an debian-like system.
